# Application Security Policies

## Secure Development Practices
- Implement secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
- Perform regular code reviews and static code analysis
- Conduct security testing (e.g., penetration testing, fuzzing) during development

## Authentication and Authorization
- Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication, OAuth)
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- Regularly review and update user access privileges

## Data Protection
- Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- Securely store and manage encryption keys
- Enforce data access controls and auditing

## Input Validation and Sanitization
- Validate and sanitize all user input data
- Protect against common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other browser security headers

## Error Handling and Logging
- Implement secure error handling and logging mechanisms
- Avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages
- Regularly review and analyze application logs for security incidents

## Third-Party Dependencies
- Regularly update third-party libraries and dependencies
- Perform security assessments on third-party components
- Implement software supply chain security practices

## Secure Configuration and Hardening
- Disable unnecessary features and services
- Implement secure configurations for web servers, application servers, and databases
- Regularly patch and update software components
